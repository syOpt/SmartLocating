# SmartLocating
* CS306 coursework. 
* SmartLocating is a distance measurement **software** based on common smartphone hardware(microphone and speaker). 
* Compared to radar used now, this measuring techonology is free from special designed hardware. This will make the system very cheap. 
* The program is currently capable of measuring distances in one dimension. Were the time for this coursework allowed and the devices(microphones) added, measurement of distance in two or three dimensions can also be achieved. We believe this device-free techonology enjoys wild application in fields like virtual reality, small-scaled radar, medical treatment...
